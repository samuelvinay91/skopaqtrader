## Natural Language Chat

The bot also understands plain text queries. A message that is not a command is routed to the AI chat brain.

**Examples:**

| Message | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| "What is TCS trading at?" | Fetches quote for TCS |
| "How is my portfolio doing?" | Shows positions and P&L |
| "Should I buy RELIANCE?" | Runs quick analysis |
| "What happened in the market today?" | Summarizes market moves |
| "analyze HDFCBANK" | Same as `/analyze HDFCBANK` |
| "trade INFY" | Explains the trade workflow |

!!! note "AI brain model"
    The natural language handler uses the `chat_brain` role from the LLM tier, which defaults to Claude Opus 4.6. If unavailable, it falls back to Gemini 3 Flash Preview.

## Notification Messages

Beyond user-initiated commands, the bot sends automatic notifications for:

| Event | Example Message |
|-------|----------------|
| Order filled | "BUY 10x RELIANCE @ Rs 2,485 -- FILLED" |
| GTT triggered | "GTT TRIGGERED: HDFCBANK -- order executed at Rs 1,450" |
| Position alert | "NEW HIGH: TCS LTP Rs 3,900 (+2.5%)" |
| Stop warning | "STOP WARNING: INFY approaching stop-loss at Rs 1,400" |
| Market scan | "Market Scan: RELIANCE +1.5%, HDFCBANK +0.8%..." |
| EOD summary | "Market Closed -- Total P&L: Rs +2,340" |

## Message Formatting

The bot uses plain text (not Markdown) for maximum compatibility. Key formatting conventions:

- Stock symbols in UPPERCASE
- Prices prefixed with "Rs"
- Positive P&L shown with `+` prefix
- Negative P&L shown with `-` prefix
- Numbers formatted in Indian number system (lakhs/crores)

!!! tip "Register for alerts"
    Send `/start` at least once to register your chat ID. Without this, you will not receive automated notifications (scans, trade alerts, EOD summaries).
